# Main Page
Hello! This is the main page of the website. Here are the steps to set it up on your PC and use it:

- Clone the [repo](https://github.com/PESU-Coders/you-know-what)
- CD to the repo directory
```bash
cd you-know-what
```
- Install dependencies (make sure you have Node.js installed)
```bash
npm install
```
- Start development server
```bash
npx retype start
```
- Visit <https://localhost:5000> to see your page in action!

## Adding Content
Just create separate `.md` files for each page you want, like [this one](/foo) and if you want many pages organized under one name, create them in a directory, [like this](/group/page.md).  

For configuration options and components, check [Retype's site](https://retype.com/).
